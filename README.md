# ToDo-WebApplication
It is a ToDo web appliction where you can list all the task you need to complete, or things you want to do.

To complete this web application i used :
1. Node.js 
   - Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the Chrome V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser

2. Express.js 
   -Express.js, or simply Express, is a back end web application framework for Node.js.
   -I used express to create my server and run it.

3. EJS
   - I used EJS as my templete engine which allowed me to generate full-blown HTML pages which certainly enables a "proper front-end".

4. MongoDB
   - I used MongoDB as my database to store the task as objects.

5. Mongoose
   - Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node. js. It manages relationships between data, provides schema validation, and is used to translate between objects in code and the representation of those objects in MongoDB.

6. Robo3T
   - Robo 3T (formerly Robomongo) is a popular desktop graphical user interface (GUI) for your MongoDB hosting deployments that allows you to interact with your data through visual indicators instead of a text-based interface.
